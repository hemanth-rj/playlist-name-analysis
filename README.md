# playlist-name-analysis
Analyze the words used to name the playlists. Count the frequency of words occurring and produce a chart depicting the same.

This project was done to understand what sort of words/terminologies users use to name their playlists. There are 3 things that happen -
1. Count the frequency
2. Visualise the frequency of words through a world cloud chart

This basically helps the music curators to understand the approach that they have to take in order to improve their editorial efforts.
